# Blackjack

Experiment in working with Coffeescript, Backbone, and Socket.io to make a playable game of blackjack.

Virtually all of the logic (and unfortunately game ending conditions) happens on the server. Playing around here has made me interested in writing both a simple logging application and spinning out a more generic card platform, tentatively titled [hitMe!](https://github.com/jyoko/hitMe).
